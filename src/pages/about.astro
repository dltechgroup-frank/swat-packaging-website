            <p>
              When we started in 1995, Tijuana's maquiladora industry needed a packaging partner who understood both sides of the border. Not a supplier shipping in from hundreds of miles away — but an engineering team embedded in the same industrial parks as the production lines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three decades later, that same principle drives everything we do. We've grown from corrugated basics to ISO 13485-certified medical device packaging, RFID-enabled smart labeling, and AI-driven automated kitting. But our advantage hasn't changed: <strong class="text-veritiv-900">we're here, on the ground, where the work happens.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, the acquisition of Orora Packaging Solutions by Veritiv brought global distribution scale to our local expertise. As the SWAT Packaging Team, we now combine Veritiv's Fortune 500 resources with the agility and deep regional knowledge that only 30 years in the CaliBaja corridor can provide.

              Like its namesake, our team deploys as a <strong class="text-veritiv-900">specialized tactical unit</strong> — we handle the complex cross-border packaging challenges that standard procedures can't solve. Speed, precision, and engineering depth are our defining traits.
