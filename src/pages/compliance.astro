        <p class="mt-6 text-body-muted leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          Cross-border packaging isn't just about materials and design. Every shipment crossing the U.S.-Mexico border faces a web of tariff codes, rules of origin, sustainability mandates, and documentation requirements. A single compliance gap can trigger costly delays, duties, or rejected shipments.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-body-muted leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          SWAT Packaging integrates trade compliance directly into the packaging engineering process — so your solutions are built to clear checkpoints, not just protect products.

            <p class="text-body-muted leading-relaxed text-sm">
              With USMCA in full effect, manufacturers must demonstrate that their packaging materials meet Regional Value Content thresholds. Failure to document RVC properly can expose shipments to Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rates — often 5-25% of goods value. SWAT Packaging engineers designs that inherently meet these thresholds and provides the documentation to prove it.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-veritiv-900 mb-4">Sustainability as Strategy</h3>
            <p class="text-body-muted leading-relaxed text-sm">
              Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws are no longer optional. By 2026, manufacturers must demonstrate end-of-life pathways for their packaging materials. APR-PCR-101 certification ensures traceable post-consumer resin content for ESG reporting. SWAT Packaging provides both the materials and the documentation your sustainability team needs.

            <p class="text-body-muted leading-relaxed text-sm">
              Every pallet we ship includes comprehensive compliance documentation: certificates of origin, RVC calculations, material safety data sheets, and sustainability certifications. Our packaging doesn't just protect your products — it protects your business from regulatory risk.
            </p>

            <p class="text-body-muted leading-relaxed text-sm">
              Rather than retrofitting compliance after design, we build regulatory requirements into the engineering process from day one. This approach eliminates costly redesigns and ensures every solution ships compliant on the first run.
